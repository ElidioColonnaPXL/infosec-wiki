# Sysinternals Suite

The [SysInternals Tools suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals) is a set of portable Windows applications that can be used to administer Windows systems (for the most part without requiring installation). The tools can be either downloaded from the Microsoft website or by loading them directly from an internet-accessible file share by typing `\\live.sysinternals.com\tools` into a Windows Explorer window.

For example, we can run procdump.exe directly from this share without downloading it directly to disk.
