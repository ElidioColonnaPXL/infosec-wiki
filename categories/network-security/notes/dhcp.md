#### How DHCP Works
Below, we break down each step of the DORA process:

|**Step**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`1. Discover`|When a device connects to the network, it broadcasts a **DHCP Discover** message to find available DHCP servers.|
|`2. Offer`|DHCP servers on the network receive the discover message and respond with a **DHCP Offer** message, proposing an IP address lease to the client.|
|`3. Request`|The client receives the offer and replies with a **DHCP Request** message, indicating that it accepts the offered IP address.|
|`4. Acknowledge`|The DHCP server sends a **DHCP Acknowledge** message, confirming that the client has been assigned the IP address. The client can now use the IP address to communicate on the network.|
